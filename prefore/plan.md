# my coding plan for MCM

in total 33 types of problems, 7 types per day, 5 days in total

## day1

### predict problems

1. differential equation
2. time sequence
3. regression analysis
4. grey model
5. logistic model

### optimize problems

1. integer algorithm
2. GA(genetic algorithm)
3. linear algorithm
4. random algorithm
5. annealing method

study loop:

1. according to ppt, summarize the aspects of the problem
2. list aspects, learn the corresponding knowledge
3. summarize the knowledge, and write down the corresponding code
